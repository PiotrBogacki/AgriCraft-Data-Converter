# AgriCraft Data Converter

A simple Python script that converts old AgriCraft data to the 1.20+ format.

## How to Use

1. **Setup:**
   - Create a new directory with all the scripts.
   - Inside this directory, create a subfolder named `old`.

2. **Add Your Data:**
   - Place your old AgriCraft data into the `old` folder. The folder structure should match the structure used in [AgriCraft/AgriPlants](https://github.com/AgriCraft/AgriPlants).

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute `updater.py`.
   - Check the console for any files that were skipped.

4. **When the Script is Done:**
   - After running the script, you will find a new directory named `new` containing `datapack.zip`. 
   - `datapack.zip` can be added to the `datapacks` directory of your Minecraft world.

## TODO 
1. Create a working resource pack based on the plants data
